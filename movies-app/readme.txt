CRUD app for cinema management that combines MERN stack: joins MongoDB & Express.js with the ReactJS framework. Able to be used from the browser as well as via an API tester (such as Postman or Insomnia).

To configure everything, simply run "npm run wizard" from the main directory. It will download all of the necessary dependencies and run all of the required programs. I wrote the scripts to make it all easy and simple. :)
If there are any errors, please look inside the "package.json" file and see if your paths match. If not then set to whatever your path is.

MongoDB: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.6\bin
MongoDB Compass: C:\Program Files\MongoDB Compass\MongoDBCompass.exe
Insomnia: C:\Users\Korisnik\AppData\Local\insomnia\Insomnia.exe
